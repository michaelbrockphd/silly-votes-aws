# Silly Votes (AWS)

Self exercise to create Silly Votes (again) but using AWS Lambdas and other services.

At the time of writing, attempts are being made to build the site from scratch and not with Amplify.

This is so it can be learned what it is Amplify does on one's behalf (e.g. what permissions/policies via AIM are set).
